- 👋 Hi, I’m @bazinga183
- 👀 I’m interested in learning as much as I can about coding as I am a relative newcomer to the field.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C, Python, and anything that data boot camps throw my way
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that would help broaden my experience in coding, as my main goal is to learn as much as possible.
- 📫 How to reach me: this account or send an email to eddie.flores183@gmail.com.
